## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Walk & Parse** - Added a clearer empty-state placeholder for “Current Result” when no results are present. [cite:102]

### Fixed
- **Walker** - Implemented missing “Clear results” handler and fixed delete-history click causing unintended navigation. [cite:102]
- **Traps** - Fixed trap detail modal “Copy” breaking due to JSON quotes in inline handlers; ensured row action buttons don’t submit forms unintentionally (added `type="button"`). [cite:102]
- **Browser** - Fixed search clear icon visibility/state issues and standardized visibility toggling using class-based approach. [cite:102]
- **MIB Manager / Settings / UI** - Standardized dynamic show/hide behavior to use `classList` (`d-none`) instead of inline `style.display` where it was causing visibility bugs. [cite:102]

### Changed
- **UI/UX Consistency** - Unified card headers (dark theme, consistent height/alignment), standardized button sizing, and made card borders more visible across pages. [cite:102]


## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Simulator** - Runtime metrics (uptime, SNMP request count, relative last activity). [cite:102]
- **Simulator** - Activity log persistence + search/filter/export, plus improved feedback (log + toast style messaging). [cite:102]
- **Simulator** - JSON validation + unsaved changes indicator / warning. [cite:102]

### Changed
- **Simulator** - Improved state management and UX while running (config lock/disable patterns). [cite:102]

### Fixed
- **Simulator** - More robust error handling for start/stop/restart/status flows. [cite:102]


## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **MIB Browser** - Interactive tree explorer with dual view modes (by module/OID hierarchy)
- **Tree Navigation** - Expandable OID hierarchy with configurable depth (1-5 levels, default: 3)
- **Real-time Search** - Find OIDs by name, numeric OID, or description with 500ms debounce
- **Smart Filtering** - Filter by module and object type (scalars, tables, columns, notifications)
- **Details Panel** - Compact metadata display with breadcrumb navigation
- **Seamless Integration** - Jump to Walker/Trap Sender with pre-filled data
- **State Persistence** - Remembers filters, search, expanded nodes, and selected OID across page switches
- **System MIB Detection** - Visual distinction between loaded MIBs (blue) and built-in MIBs (gray)
- **Trap Library Enhancement** - Shows all 24 traps (19 from loaded MIBs + 5 from system MIBs)
- **Dashboard Card** - Added MIB Browser card with purple theme
- **Depth Control** - Dropdown selector for expansion depth with expand/collapse buttons
- **Copy Buttons** - One-click copy for OID and full name in details panel
- **Loading Indicators** - Spinner and notifications for expand/collapse operations

### Fixed
- **Trap Count Consistency** - Dashboard, MIB Manager, and Browser now show consistent trap counts
- **MIB Delete Function** - Fixed error handling when deleting MIB files
- **State Restoration** - Fixed search clear icon visibility after page switch
- **Expanded State** - Tree expansion state now properly restored after navigation
- **Selected Node** - Details panel correctly loads after page switch
- **System MIB Badge** - SNMPv2-MIB and RMON-MIB correctly marked as system only when not loaded

### Changed
- **UI/UX Consistency** - Unified styling across all components
- **Trap Manager** - Renamed "Available Traps" to "Trap Library" for clarity
- **Dashboard Polling** - Reduced from 5s to 10s for better performance
- **Backend Caching** - Added 60-second cache for trap list API calls
- **Component Overview** - Updated README with compact overview of all 6 components

### Performance
- **Backend Caching** - Trap list cached for 60 seconds (reduces repeated queries)
- **Lazy Loading** - Tree nodes load children on-demand
- **Efficient Rendering** - Only visible nodes rendered in tree
- **Debounced Search** - 500ms delay prevents excessive API calls
